# POSTGRESQL PRACTICE
Using Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) PostgreSQL to implement the core database functionalities of an online store website.

Did everything with pgAdmin, so i would need to move the schema scripts, the idea was just to use it for the first time
+ Main logic in stored procedures and functions see `functions` and `procedures` folders.
+ Worked with Stripe API to implement payment system.
+ Did some unit tests with Jest.


Next one will be a precise usage.
